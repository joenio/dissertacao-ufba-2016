  year = {2014},
  pages = {295-304},
  abstract = {Pattern search of programs is a fundamental function for supporting programming. In this paper, we propose a search method for unpreprocessed programs, which are difficult to parse. Our parser directly parses them by rewriting token sequences, and allows minor errors in syntax trees. The search tool takes queries that are the same as the format of program fragments. By using the same parser for both queries and target programs, programmers have no need to describe the detail structures of syntax trees in queries. To support accurate search, we also show an alignment tool for branch directives, which converts undisciplined directives to discipline ones, and a reverse macro expansion tool, which integrates the use of macro calls. Finally, we present some experiments in which we have applied the tools to an open source application, and discuss how to improve our tools.},

The approach is based on a pushdown flow analysis that besides traditional control and value flow also keeps track of write effects. To increase the precision of our purity analysis, we combine it with an intraprocedural analysis to determine freshness of variables and object references. We formalize the core aspects of our analysis, and discuss our implementation used to analyze several common JavaScript benchmarks. Experiments show that our technique is capable of detecting function purity, even in the presence of higher-order functions, dynamic property expressions, and prototypal inheritance.},

  abstract = {Proving program termination is key to guaranteeing absence of undesirable behaviour, such as hanging programs and even security vulnerabilities such as denial-of-service attacks. To make termination checks scale to large systems, interprocedural termination analysis seems essential, which is a largely unexplored area of research in termination analysis, where most effort has focussed on difficult single-procedure problems. We present a modular termination analysis for C programs using template-based interprocedural summarisation. Our analysis combines a context-sensitive, over-approximating forward analysis with the inference of under-approximating preconditions for termination. Bit-precise termination arguments are synthesised over lexicographic linear ranking function templates. Our experimental results show that our tool 2LS outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, and demonstrate the clear advantage of interprocedural reasoning over monolithic analysis in terms of efficiency, while retaining comparable precision.},
