  abstract={Sequentialization translates concurrent programs into equivalent nondeterministic sequential programs so that the different concurrent schedules no longer need to be handled explicitly. It can thus be used as a concurrency preprocessing technique for automated sequential program verification tools. Our CSeq tool implements a novel sequentialization for C programs using pthreads, which extends the Lal/Reps sequentialization to support dynamic thread creation. CSeq now works with three different backend tools, CBMC, ESBMC, and LLBMC, and is competitive with state-of-the-art verification tools for concurrent programs.},
