  abstract={An Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) interceptor is a software mechanism that provides for introducing behavior implemented as separate code into the execution of a Java application. In this way EJB interceptors provide a clear separation of the core functionality of the bean and other concerns, such as logging or performance analysis. Despite the beauty of the idea behind the interceptors, developing, testing and managing dependencies introduced by the interceptors are considered to be daunting tasks. For example, the developers can specify interceptors at multiple locations and by multiple means. However, different locations and specification means influence the order of the interceptor invocation, which is governed by more than fifteen different intertwined rules according to the EJB standard. To facilitate development of EJB applications we have designed I2SD, Interceptors to Sequence Diagrams, a tool for reverse engineering EJB applications with interceptors to UML sequence diagrams. I2SD provides the developer with a visual feedback and can be used by quality managers to get a broader understanding of the way interceptors are used in their project.},
