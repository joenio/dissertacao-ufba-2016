  abstract={The srcML toolkit for lightweight transformation and fact-extraction of source code is described. srcML is an XML format for C/C++/Java source code. The open source toolkit that includes the source-to-srcML and srcML-to-source translators for round-trip reverse engineering is freely available. The direct use of XPath and XSLT is supported, an archive format for large projects is included, and a rich set of input and output formats through a command-line interface is available. Applying transformations and formulating queries using srcML is very convenient. Application use-cases of transformations and fact-extraction are shown and demonstrated to be practical and scalable.},
