  abstract={The SourceMeter Sonar Qube plug-in is an extension of Sonar Qube, an open-source platform for managing code quality made by Sonar Source S.A, Switzerland. The plug-in extends the built-in Java code analysis engine of Sonar Qube with Front End ART's high-end Java code analysis engine. Most of Sonar Qubes original analysis results are replaced (including the detected source code duplications), while the range of available analyses is extended with a number of additional metrics and issue detectors. Additionally, the plug-in offers new GUI features on the Sonar Qube dashboard and drilldown views, making the Sonar Qube user experience more comfortable and the work with the tool more productive.},
