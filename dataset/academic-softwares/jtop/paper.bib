  abstract={Test case management may make the testing process more efficient and thus accelerate software delivery. With the popularity of using JUnit for testing Java software, researchers have paid attention to techniques to manage JUnit test cases in regression testing of Java software. Typically, most existing test case management tools are based on the coverage information. However, coverage information may need extra efforts to obtain. In this paper, we present an Eclipse IDE plug-in (named Jtop) for managing JUnit test cases in absence of coverage information. Jtop statically analyzes the program under test and its corresponding JUnit test cases to perform the following management tasks: regression test case selection, test suite reduction and test case prioritization. Furthermore, Jtop also enables the programmer to manually manipulate test cases through a graphical user interface.},
