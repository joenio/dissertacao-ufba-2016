Systems with graded-index and single-mode fibers in the optical short and long wavelength region were investigated. All systems include complete circuits for clock and signal regeneration. Special emphasis was laid on the development of electronic circuits for gigabit signal processing and on the investigations of the noise sources of the optical channel, which appear especially pronounced in broad-band systems. The experimental results confirm the possibility to set up reliable high-speed optical transmission systems under laboratory conditions with available components. The remaining problems are of optical and not of electronic nature, despite the fact that monolithic integrated circuits for gigabit applications are hardly commercially available today.},

  year={2007},

  pages={925-933},
  abstract={Nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) is a radio-frequency technique that can be used to detect the presence of quadrupolar nuclei, such as the 14N nucleus prevalent in many explosives and narcotics. In a typical application, one observes trains of decaying NQR echoes, in which the decay is governed by the spin echo decay time(s) of the resonant line(s). In most detection algorithms, these echoes are simply summed to produce a single echo with a higher signal-to-noise ratio, ignoring the decaying echo structure of the signal. In this paper, after reviewing current NQR signal models, we propose a novel NQR data model of the full echo train and detail why and how these echo trains are produced. Furthermore, we refine two recently proposed approximative maximum-likelihood detectors that enable the algorithms to optimally exploit the proposed echo train model. Extensive numerical evaluations based on both simulated and measured NQR data indicate that the proposed detectors offer a significant improvement as compared to current state-of-the-art detectors},

  abstract={A dependence cluster is a set of program statements all of which are mutually inter-dependent. Such clusters can cause problems for maintenance, because a change to any statement in the cluster will have a potential impact on all statements in the cluster. This paper introduces the concept of dependence clusters and dependence pollution and shows how a simple visualisation can be used to quickly and effectively locate them. The paper presents the results of two empirical studies and several case studies which evaluate the approach. The results indicate the importance of dependence cluster analysis: for a set of 20 programs, ranging in size from 1,170 LoC to 179,623 LoC, 99.6% of clusters identified were within 1% tolerance of being identical, while dependence clusters were found to be surprisingly common: 80% of the programs studied contained clusters of 10% or more of the program.},

  abstract={The objective of radiologic image compression is to reduce the data volume of and to achieve a low bit rate in the digital representation of radiologic images without perceived loss of image quality. However, the demand for transmission bandwidth and storage space in the digital radiology environment, especially picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) and teleradiology, and the proliferating use of various imaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, ultrasonography, nuclear medicine, computed radiography, and digital subtraction angiography, continue to outstrip the capabilities of existing technologies. The availability of lossy coding techniques for clinical diagnoses further implicates many complex legal and regulatory issues. This paper reviews the recent progress of lossless and lossy radiologic image compression and presents the legal challenges of using lossy compression of medical records. To do so, we first describe the fundamental concepts of radiologic imaging and digitization. Then, we examine current compression technology in the field of medical imaging and discuss important regulatory policies and legal questions facing the use of compression in this field. We conclude with a summary of future challenges and research directions},

  abstract={We develop a data alignment mechanism for sensor networks. The mechanism allows the sensor data streams to be aligned without real-time clocks or virtual clocks. The developed mechanism makes use of the built-in counters on sensors and external synchronization signals to align data streams. The data server broadcasts out-of-channel synchronization signals with constant or variable intervals. The sensor data streams are aligned when received on the server. Only one way communication is used so as to reduce the communication overhead and clock synchronization overhead on sensors nodes. In addition, the developed mechanism is scalable thanks to one way communication. The synchronization error is bounded by the maximum sampling period of the sensors, and is independent of the number of the nodes in the network. Our analysis also shows the required awake time for sensors to tolerate different clock drifts and signal lost.},

The chapter compares the small-signal input/output impedance characteristics predicted by different models. It examines the transient performance of the AVMs for various operating conditions including light and heavy loading conditions, discontinuous and continuous modes, as well as balanced and unbalanced AC side.

The nonlinear stochastic plant is expressed by an Itô-type Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy-affine model with parametric uncertainties, and a Markov process is employed to model the occurrence of actuator fault. The purpose is to design an admissible piecewise SOF controller, such that the resulting closed-loop system is stochastically stable with a prescribed disturbance attenuation level in an sense. Specifically, based on a Markovian Lyapunov function combined with Itô differential formula, S-procedure, and some matrix inequality convexification procedures, two new approaches to the reliable SOF controller analysis and synthesis are proposed for the underlying stochastic fuzzy-affine systems. It is shown that the existence of desired reliable controllers is fully characterized in terms of strict linear matrix inequalities. Finally, simulation examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the developed methods.},

  abstract={In academic empirical studies, mutation testing has been demonstrated to be a powerful technique for fault finding. However, it remains very expensive and the few valuable traditional mutants that resemble real faults are mixed in with many others that denote unrealistic faults.These twin problems of expense and realism have been a significant barrier to industrial uptake of mutation testing. Genetic programming is used to search the space of complex faults (higher order mutants). The space is much larger than the traditional first order mutation space of simple faults. However, the use of a search based approach makes this scalable, seeking only those mutants that challenge the tester, while the consideration of complex faults addresses the problem of fault realism; it is known that 90% of real faults are complex (i.e. higher order). We show that we are able to find examples that pose challenges to testing in the higher order space that cannot be represented in the first order space.},

  year={2015},
  volume={23},
  number={5},
  pages={1728-1745},
  abstract={Fuzzy regression methods have commonly been used to develop consumer preferences models, which correlate the engineering characteristics with consumer preferences regarding a new product; the consumer preference models provide a platform, whereby product developers can decide the engineering characteristics in order to satisfy consumer preferences prior to developing the products. Recent research shows that these fuzzy regression methods are commonly used to model customer preferences. However, these approaches have a common limitation in that they do not investigate the appropriate polynomial structure, which includes significant regressors with only significant engineering characteristics; also, they cannot generate interaction or high-order regressors in the models. The inclusion of insignificant regressors is not an effective approach when developing the models. Exclusion of significant regressors may affect the generalization capability of the consumer preference models. In this paper, a novel fuzzy modeling method is proposed, namely fuzzy stepwise regression (F-SR), in order to develop a customer preference model which is structured with an appropriate polynomial, which includes only significant regressors. Based on the appropriate polynomial structure, the fuzzy coefficients are determined using the fuzzy least-squares regression. The developed fuzzy regression model attempts to obtain a better generalization capability using a smaller number of regressors. The effectiveness of the F-SR is evaluated based on two design problems, namely a tea maker design and a solder paste dispenser design. Results show that better generalization capabilities can be obtained compared with the fuzzy regression methods commonly used for new product development. In addition, smaller scale consumer preference models with fewer engineering characteristics can be obtained. Hence, a simpler and more effective product development platform can be provided.},

On the other hand, with reduced input inductance, the DCM mode occurs even when the rectifier operates at full power. In this paper, the digitized feedfoward compensation method is proposed for the rectifier to reduce the impact of the switch between DCM and CCM. The theoretical analysis of the proposed method is deduced; furthermore, the control design strategy is given.

Insertion functions insert fictitious events at the output of the system, thereby obfuscating its secret behaviors. In this paper, we use insertion functions to enhance opacity for systems modeled as probabilistic finite-state automata. Specifically, we quantify each insertion function based on the opacity level that it achieves, defined as the probability that the system remains opaque. We then develop an algorithmic procedure that synthesizes an optimal insertion function that maximizes the opacity level, when the system's observable output is finite-length.},

  abstract={In this paper, a framework for the statistical design of the flip-flops circuits is proposed to achieve a high yield, while meeting the performance, leakage power, switching power, and layout area design specifications. The proposed design solution provides the nominal design parameters, i.e., the widths and lengths of the flip-flop transistors, which provide maximum immunity to the process variations in the transistor dimensions and threshold voltage. The proposed framework shows that for a given flip-flop design specifications, a certain yield can be achieved. To further increase this yield, the proposed framework shows which design specifications should be relaxed. The transmission gate-based master-slave flip-flop is selected as a design case study in this paper, however, the proposed framework is applicable to any other flip-flop circuit in the nanometer regime.},

  title={Exploiting Interference for Energy Harvesting: A Survey, Research Issues, and Challenges},
  year={2017},
  volume={5},
  pages={10403-10421},
  abstract={Interference is one of the fundamental aspects that makes wireless communication challenging, which has attracted great research attention for decades. To solve this interference problem, many interference management (IM) techniques have been developed. Nevertheless, interference can also provide some benefits to wireless networks if it is properly utilized according to the latest research advances. Wireless signal can carry information as well as energy, and thus the redundant resource of interference can be exploited using energy harvesting (EH) to provide the power to support the operation of wireless nodes. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the research works of exploiting interference for wireless EH. Some fundamental aspects are first reviewed, including the receiver architecture, antenna dimension, network topology, and IM techniques, for wireless EH systems that exploit interference. Then, two IM techniques for wireless EH, beamforming optimization and interference alignment, are discussed in detail. In addition, several research issues are also presented, including the adversarial jamming signal and artificial noise for EH. Finally, some research challenges of exploiting interference for wireless EH are discussed.},

  title={A New Model Reference Adaptive Controller for Four Quadrant Vector Controlled Induction Motor Drives},

  volume={59},
  number={10},
  pages={3757-3767},
  abstract={In this paper, a new model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) for the speed estimation of the vector-controlled induction motor drive is presented. The proposed MRAC is formed using instantaneous and steady-state values of X (= v⃗* × i⃗ where v = voltage and i = current vector in synchronously rotating reference frame), which is a fictitious quantity and has no physical significance. This formulation is not only simply realizable but also made the sensorless drive stable in all the four quadrants of operation. Speed estimation does not involve computation of stator or rotor flux. Requirement of no additional sensors makes the drive suitable for retrofit applications. A simple modification of the controller can estimate the stator resistance in all the four quadrants of operation, if speed signal is available. The proposed MRAC-based speed sensorless vector control drive as well as the stator resistance estimation technique has been simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK and experimentally validated through a dSPACE-1104-based laboratory prototype. A study on stability of such systems is also added.},

  title={Digital-to-analogue conversion using pulse width modulation},
  year={1993},
  volume={5},
  number={6},
  pages={339-348},
  abstract={Pulse width modulation (PWM) has found application in various situations where efficient delivery of high power is required. In this paper its use in the conversion of signals from digital to analogue representations is addressed, i.e. as a digital-to-analogue converter (DAC), and it is shown that there are many advantages in using PWM over conventional DAC methods and that high resolution and accuracy can be achieved. One advantage is that, provided a suitable output stage can be provided, a complete, high-power, high-resolution digital-to-analogue power converter can be constructed. Because this work was motivated by the author's interest in digital audio, such a device has come to be known as a digital (power) amplifier. The article describes PWM, particularly in its digital forms, and shows how to make it practical for use as a DAC. This involves various digital signal processing stages prior to the final modulator. Results are presented from simulations and from demonstrator hardware.<>},
