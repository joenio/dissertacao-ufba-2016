  title={DRC: A detection tool for dangling references in PHP-based web applications},
  year={2013},
  pages={1299-1302},
  abstract={PHP is a server-side language that is widely used for creating dynamic Web applications. However, as a dynamic language, PHP may induce certain programming errors that reveal themselves only at run time. A common type of error is dangling references, which occur if the referred program entities have not been declared in the current program execution. To prevent the run-time errors caused by such dangling references, we introduce Dangling Reference Checker (DRC), a novel tool to statically detect those references in the source code of PHP-based Web applications. DRC first identifies the path constraints of the program executions in which a program entity appears and then matches the path constraints of the entity's declarations and references to detect dangling ones. DRC is able to detect dangling reference errors in several real-world PHP systems with high accuracy. The video demonstration for DRC is available at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dy_AKZYhLlU4.},

  title={Architectural support for low overhead detection of memory violations},
  year={2009},
  pages={652-657},
  abstract={Violations in memory references cause tremendous loss of productivity, catastrophic mission failures, loss of privacy and security, and much more. Software mechanisms to detect memory violations have high false positive and negative rates or huge performance overhead. This paper proposes architectural support to detect memory reference violations in inherently unsafe languages such as C and C++. In this approach, the ISA is extended to include ldquosafetyrdquo instructions that provide compile-time information on pointers and objects. The microarchitecture is extended to efficiently execute the safety instructions. We explore optimizations, such as delayed violation detection and stack-based handling of local pointers, to reduce the performance overhead. Our experiments show that the synergy between hardware and software results in this approach having less than 5% average performance overhead, while an exclusively software mechanism incurs 480% impact for the same benchmarks.},

  title={Dangling references in multi-configuration and dynamic PHP-based Web applications},
  year={2013},
  pages={399-409},
  abstract={PHP is a dynamic language popularly used in Web development for writing server-side code to dynamically create multiple versions of client-side pages at run time for different configurations. A PHP program contains code to be executed or produced for multiple configurations/versions. That dynamism and multi-configuration nature leads to dangling references. Specifically, in the execution for a configuration, a reference to a variable or a call to a function is dangling if its corresponding declaration cannot be found. We conducted an exploratory study to confirm the existence of such dangling reference errors including dangling cross-language and embedded references in the client-side HTML/JavaScript code and in data-accessing SQL code that are embedded in scattered PHP code. Dangling references have caused run-time fatal failures and security vulnerabilities. We developed DRC, a static analysis method to detect such dangling references. DRC uses symbolic execution to collect PHP declarations/references and to approximate all versions of the generated output, and then extracts embedded declarations/references. It associates each detected declaration/reference with a conditional constraint that represents the execution paths (i.e. configurations/versions) containing that declaration/reference. It then validates references against declarations via a novel dangling reference detection algorithm. Our empirical evaluation shows that DRC detects dangling references with high accuracy. It revealed 83 yet undiscovered defects caused by dangling references.},

  abstract={MIPS-X is a high performance RISC microprocessor that can run with a peak throughput of 16 MIPS. The design began in the spring of 1984, and in the summer of 1987 we were able to execute Pascal programs on a prototype system. This paper describes the design of MIPS-X examining the strengths and weaknesses of our tools, methodology and design environment. We found that consistency within a representation and across representations of the design was an important issue and that having an executable description of the design in the form of a functional simulator was key to the success of our project. We describe a technique we call comparison-mode simulation that made final verification and system integration much easier.},
