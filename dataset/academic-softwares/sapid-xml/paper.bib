  abstract={Recent IDEs have become more extensible tool platforms but do not concern themselves with how other tools running on them collaborate with each other. They compel developers to use proprietary representations or the classical abstract syntax tree (AST) to build source code tools. Although these representations contain sufficient information, they are neither portable nor extensible. This paper proposes a tool platform that manages commonly used, fined-grained, information about Java source code by using an XML representation. Our representation is suitable for developing tools which browse and manipulate actual source code since the original code is annotated with tags based on its structure and retained within the tags. Additionally, it exposes information resulting from global semantic analysis, which is never provided by the typical AST. Our proposed platform allows the developers to extend the representation for the purpose of sharing or exchanging various kinds of information about the source code, and also enables them to build new tools by using existing XML utilities},
