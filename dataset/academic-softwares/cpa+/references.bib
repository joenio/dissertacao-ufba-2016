  abstract={Mapping an algorithm on a configurable architecture containing several types of function units requires an efficient allocation of the available computational resources to the various operations in order to exploit the parallelism and minimize the execution time. This resource scheduling/allocation problem consists of determining when and on which unit to schedule a given task with the objective of minimizing total execution time, while respecting precedence relations and resource constraints. In this paper, we use a branch and bound search method with a non deterministic heuristic to find quasi optimal solution to the allocation problem. Partial schedules are built up starting at time 0 and proceed systematically by adding at each decision point subsets of activities until a complete feasible schedule is obtained. At each decision point m, the procedure identifies all operations that can be put in progress according to precedence rules. If it is impossible to schedule all eligible activities at time m, a heuristic is used to determine which operations are to be scheduled and which are to be delayed. The key idea of the heuristic is that, given the set of available resources (AR) and the set of candidate operations (SC) that meet precedence constraints, the criteria for matching operation j with resource k is a probabilistic decision based on quantifying the opportunity cost of k and the scheduling urgency of j},

  pages={621-634},
  abstract={This paper proposes a splittable amplifier technique that can be either decomposed into two identical halves or merged for enhancing the utilization of the amplifier power and alleviating the memory effect, when applying operational amplifier (opamp) sharing. In a two-phase clock system, the amplifier can be split into two identical small amplifiers in one phase simultaneously for use in two circuits. Next, the two small amplifiers can be merged into one amplifier in the other phase for usage in another circuit. Compared with the conventional opamp sharing, a more power-efficient amplifier arrangement is achieved in the split mode. In this paper, three individual sample-and-hold (S/H) circuits with the proposed technique are designed to demonstrate the efficiency of memory effect cancellation. The simulations show that in contrast to the output spectrum of two S/H circuits with conventional opamp sharing, the spurious tones due to the memory effect can be suppressed by at least 14.66 dB in the split mode and at least 7.32 dB in the combination mode with a 0.6-VP-P input signal when using the proposed technique.},

  abstract={A distributed model has been derived for MIM capacitors using a simple coupled-transmission-line approach. The model has been compared with measured S-parameter data from MIM capacitors having different aspect ratios fabricated on 4-mil GaAs substrates. The agreement is very good. The derived model will converge to the first-order capacitor model, generally given in the literature, under a few assumptions.},

  abstract={We present and evaluate a framework and tool for combining multiple program analyses which allows the dynamic (on-line) adjustment of the precision of each analysis depending on the accumulated results. For example, the explicit tracking of the values of a variable may be switched off in favor of a predicate abstraction when and where the number of different variable values that have been encountered has exceeded a specified threshold. The method is evaluated on verifying the SSH client/server software and shows significant gains compared with predicate abstraction-based model checking.},
