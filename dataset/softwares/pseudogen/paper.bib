  abstract={Understanding the behavior of source code written in an unfamiliar programming language is difficult. One way to aid understanding of difficult code is to add corresponding pseudo-code, which describes in detail the workings of the code in a natural language such as English. In spite of its usefulness, most source code does not have corresponding pseudo-code because it is tedious to create. This paper demonstrates a tool Pseudogen that makes it possible to automatically generate pseudo-code from source code using statistical machine translation (SMT). Pseudogen currently supports generation of English or Japanese pseudo-code from Python source code, and the SMT framework makes it easy for users to create new generators for their preferred source code/pseudo-code pairs.},
